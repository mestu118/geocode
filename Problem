Problem:
Using the Google Maps API, we want you retrieve the JSON response after applying a query parameter filter to the geocode endpoint.
Next, take that response and use any code you are familiar with to transform the response and produce the expected output below.
Starting endpoint: http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json
Apply a query parameter to get the address for Green Bay and transform the response.
Expected transformed output:

Green Bay
ID: <insert the place_id here>
Latitude: <insert latitude here>
Longitude: <insert longitude here>

Anything else you would like to include that is important to this work

Process Steps:
1. I have worked with Google Maps before and retrieved information utilizing JavaSript. I will
go to developers.google.com/maps/ to see exactly how to make a json request.

2. After researching I have received how to make a geocode request through this website

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start

3. After understanding how the request will work, I understrand that the request can be made as such:

http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=GreenBay

4. Getting a key from Google Maps API, sucessfully obtained the key which can be obtained from the code as api_key

5. After getting the key, I wanted to figure out how to make the request through python. I took a look at the following website:

https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started

6. I looked at their example named 'simple_api_cmd_line_books.py'. I understood it well but then I realized that the 'build' from
apiclient.discovery did not have geocoding.

7. Searched how to make a simple request using python and found this tutorial very useful:

http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/

8. Began a simple implementation of the requests

9. Needed to enable the geocode implementation from Google Maps Geocoding API

10. Made the request:

http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=GreenBay

11. Looked at how the Json object is presented, I will print the values accordingly
