Process Steps:
1. I have worked with Google Maps before and retrieved information utilizing JavaSript. I will go to developers.google.com/maps/ to see exactly how to make a json request.

2. After researching I have received how to make a geocode request through this website

https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start

3. After understanding how the request will work, I understand that the request can be made as such:

http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=GreenBay

4. Getting a key from Google Maps API. Successfully obtained the key which can be obtained from the code as ‘api_key’

5. After getting the key, I wanted to figure out how to make the request through python. I took a look at the following website:

https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/start/get_started

6. I looked at their example named 'simple_api_cmd_line_books.py' which is also provided in the submission. I understood it well but then I realized that the 'build' from
apiclient.discovery did not have geocoding so I am unable to make a geocode request through this method.

7. Searched how to make a simple request using python and found this tutorial very useful:

http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/

8. Began a simple implementation of the requests

9. Needed to enable the geocode implementation from Google Maps Geocoding API

10. Made the request:

http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=GreenBay

11. Looked at how the Json object is presented, I will print the values accordingly

Answer(Code can be tested to confirm results):
Input: “Green Bay”

Output:
Green Bay
ID: ChIJ84CzCejiAogRcfXcFFIEcGM
Latitude: 44.5133188
Longitude: -88.0132958

Input: “Buffalo”

Output:
Buffalo
ID: ChIJoeXfUmES04kRcYEfGKUEI5g
